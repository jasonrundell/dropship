# Paragraph

## A container used for spacing around elements

The Paragraph component is used to create a paragraph element.

<ArgsTable story="Default" />

export const Template = (args) => <Paragraph {...args} />

export const Example = () =>
  'The sun was setting over the mountain range, casting a beautiful orange and pink glow across the sky. As the last rays of light disappeared behind the peaks, a cool breeze swept through the valley, rustling the leaves of the tall trees. The peaceful sound of a nearby stream provided a soothing background for the peaceful scene. Birds chirped in the distance, signaling the end of another day in the serene wilderness.'

## Default

  <Story
    name="Default"
    args={{
