# Container

## A container used for spacing around elements

The Container component is used to create a container which is useful for layout
purposes.

<ArgsTable story="Default" />

export const Template = (args) => <Container {...args} />

export const exampleText =
  "The old castle stood tall and proud, its stone walls weathered by centuries of wind and rain. The turrets reached high into the sky, casting a long shadow over the surrounding countryside. The moat was dry and overgrown, but the drawbridge still stood, a testament to the castle's past glory. As I walked through the crumbling halls, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder at the history that was embedded in every stone. The castle may have been abandoned, but its presence was still felt in every corner."

export const Paragraph = ({ children }) => <p>{children}</p>

export const Example = () => <Paragraph>{exampleText}</Paragraph>

## Default

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Default"

</Canvas>

      children: Example()
    }}
    play={async ({ canvasElement }) => {
      const canvas = within(canvasElement)
      const theElement = canvas.getByText(exampleText)
      // ðŸ‘‡ Simulate interactions with the component
      await expect(theElement).not.toBeNull()
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
