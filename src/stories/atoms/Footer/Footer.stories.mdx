# Footer

## The Footer `<footer>` element.

A container used for grouping footer content.

<ArgsTable story="Default" />

export const Template = (args) => <Footer {...args} />

export const exampleText =
  "The sound of waves crashing against the shore was the only thing that broke the silence. The beach was deserted, save for a lone figure walking along the water's edge. The sand was cool beneath their feet and the water was a deep blue, stretching out to the horizon. The sun was setting, painting the sky with shades of pink and orange. It was a moment of pure serenity, a chance to escape the chaos of daily life and just be in the present. It was a place where one could find peace and tranquility."

export const Example = () => (
  <Container>
    <Section>
      <Footer>
        <Paragraph>{exampleText}</Paragraph>
      </Footer>
    </Section>
  </Container>
)
