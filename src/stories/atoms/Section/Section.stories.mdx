# Section

## The HTML `<section>` element.

The Section component is used to create a section element and group content.

<ArgsTable story="Default" />

export const Template = (args) => <Section {...args} />

export const Example = () =>
  'The city was bustling with activity as people rushed to and fro on the busy streets. Cars honked and sirens blared as the hustle and bustle of daily life continued on. Amidst the chaos, a young woman sat on a park bench, reading a book. She was lost in her own world, completely oblivious to the noise around her. The sun was shining bright and the smell of fresh flowers was in the air. The city may have been hectic, but for her, it was a peaceful oasis in the middle of it all.'
